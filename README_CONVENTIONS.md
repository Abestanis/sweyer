# Conventions

1. Each folder in `lib` represents its own module and has a file inside it with the same name. This is an export file for all other `.dart` files and other modules inside this folder. Every such export file also has some description inside it
2. Any name that conflicts with name from flutter framework itself has a special `SMM` prefix, which is an acronym from `Sweden Music Player`
