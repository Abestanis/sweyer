# Flutter Music Player

This is an open-source non-commercial repo of music player that is built with flutter
This app is just my vision of how UI/UX in music apps should be

You can pull it if you want, run `flutter build apk` and start testing it on your device (Android only)

## In plans

* Albums and artists grouping support
* More extended playlist capabilities
* Full media buttons and maximum devices support
* Desktop widgets
* Desktop context menu
* Open music files with player
* Flexible personalization settings
* Exif-data editor
* Integration with some music API (lyrics, album arts, etc., maybe even machine learning)
