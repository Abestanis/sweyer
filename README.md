# Sweyer

This is an open-source non-commercial repo of music player that is built with flutter
This app is just my vision of how UI/UX in music apps should be
Currently I am building it only for Android

Some conventions that I use when I write my application can be found in [README_CONVENTIONS.md](https://github.com/nt4f04uNd/sweyer/blob/master/README_CONVENTIONS.md) file

## Demos

## In plans

* Albums and artists grouping support
* More extended playlist capabilities
* Full media buttons and maximum devices support
* Desktop widgets
* Desktop context menu
* Open music files with player
* Flexible personalization settings
* Exif-data editor
* Integration with some music API (lyrics, album arts, etc., maybe even machine learning)
