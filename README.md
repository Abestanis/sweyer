# Flutter Music Player

This is an open-source non-commercial repo of music player that is built with flutter
This app is just my vision of how UI/UX in music apps should be

Some conventions that I use whe I write my application can be found in [README_CONVENTIONS.md](https://github.com/nt4f04uNd/flutter_music_player/blob/master/README_CONVENTIONS.md) file

You can pull it if you want, run `flutter build apk` and start testing it on your device (Android only)
